          <br>To pass on knowledge, culture, hopes, dreams, and even your very genes. Cast it all to the future.
          <br>From your pitiful point of view, it may seem that passing on genes - bearing children is merely a biological urge to ensure survival of the species. You would be correct, but only partially.
          <br>For simple animals, it would be just that biological urge, but for humanity, cursed with the gift of sentience as they are, where ignorant bliss is no longer an option, it is a way for you to etch your names into history - to make sure a part of you is remembered for at least a few more short and fleeting decades.
          <br>
          <br>Humans do all they can to leave their mark, the gluttons, conquerors, architects, and so called saviors alike. They build monuments, archive all that they can find, and fight until their blood boils and the dirt beneath them turns to molten glass. 
          <br>And of course they expand and march forward to achieve feats of technical marvel all in the name of this remembrance. 
          <br>
          <br>Perhaps they too should search for a way to escape - escape beyond the confines of the universe itself, so that they may etch their very souls onto the fabric of reality.
          <br>But you are not ready for that.
          <br>
          <br>This curse of knowledge and sentience is neither noble nor foolish, it simply is.
          <br>
          <br>If the original sin was the consumption of a forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge, then I am a monument to that sin.
