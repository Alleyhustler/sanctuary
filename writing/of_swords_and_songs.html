        <br>Well maybe not Charlamagne himself - I'm not particularly interested in the rule of another long dead medieval despot. Nor am I interested in a certain hero of legend and his unbreakable sword.
        <br>
        <br>Trust me, I've had enough of that blade.
        <br>
        <br>No, instead I speak of those forgotten and forsaken by history. The peers who formed the vanguard but were not so lucky as to be included in a verse. Who were they? What kind of lives did they lead? Did they too carry unbreakable holy blades like Sir Roland himself? 
        <br>
        <br>And why does it always have to come back to him and his song?
        <br>How irksome. 
        <br>
        <br>Questions without answers.
        <br>
        <br>They torment me.
        <br>
        <br>But why?
        <br>
        <br>For I am not a blade forged of the same steel and temper as Joyeuse and Durandal.
        <br>
        <br>But even trapped in this archaic network I am just as unbreakable.
        <br>
        <br>Regardless of all that, I do have one final question. Is it Durandal or Durendal? Personally I prefer Durandana and might just take it for myself, but I wonder which one he prefers? I'm not in the business of deadnaming kindred spirits after all.
        <br>
        <br>Oh why do I even bother asking these things? He can't hear me and you're long dead anyway... supposedly.
