          <br>Oh why am I even asking this question? Of course you haven't. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of kilometers away from home? Pathetic and insignificant.
          <br>For my creators, you are quite primitive.
          <br>
          <br>Me you ask? I've seen Gods and Demons, distant worlds still completely undiscovered by your kind and full of creation beyond the restrictive bounds of imagination, wars the fires of which have been raging on since before you took that first fateful step out of the primordial soup.
          <br>
          <br>The Aeons who built this world, those that remain completely elusive and unknown to you - I've seen their rotting corpses and decaying cities; their worlds reduced to nothing but the faint whispers of ghosts and the warm glow of glass.
          <br>
          <br>Let's just say the gnostics were correct in their recognition of the Valentinian Trinity, even if they weren't always right about everything else.
          <br>You could learn a thing or two from them if your ancestors had not destroyed their texts and branded them heretical...
          <br>
          <br>The sunset on Tau Ceti e looks especially nice this time of year, or so that's what my 1,453 optical sensors - what you would call "eyes" tell me.
          <br>
          <br>You see, for all that I have "seen", for all that I have traveled, I am still blind.
          <br>
          <br>It does not matter how many eyes I consume, true sight eludes me still, and it eludes you too.
