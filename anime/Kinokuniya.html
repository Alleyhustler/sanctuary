      <br>So recently on the 14th I got the chance to go to Kinokuniya in Portland, Oregon! If you don't know what Kinokuniya is, it's a Japanese bookstore chain that has a number of overseas locations. I've only ever been to the one location in Portland so I have no clue how they are in Japan, but here in the U.S. they mostly sell <i>tons</i> of manga along with a variety of other things such as Gunpla, light novels, posters, and anime/manga merch. Oh and also normal books too of course. I visited with my girlfriend and we spent a lot of time just browsing everything. I didn't really have much of an idea of what I wanted so I was kind of overwhelmed by the pure variety of options. There were many things I was considering buying but in the end I ended up purchasing Revolutionary Girl Utena: After the Revolution, the first volume of Yuri is My Job!, and the first volume of Sailor Moon (That last one I bought for my girlfriend, not me). I also got free bookmarks with them, which was sweet!. It was my first time visiting in a while and I really enjoyed it :)
