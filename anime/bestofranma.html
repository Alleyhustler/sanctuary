      For the first time since around 2009 probably, I have come into possession of a VCR. It's one of those DVD/VCR combo players but the DVD side is non functioning - not that it matters since I already have a million different DVD players and really only wanted it for the VCR half. Anyway what was the first thing I did when I got a hold of it? Why look for anime VHS tapes of course! That's where I stumbled upon this - The Best of Ranma ½ Collection. A set of 3 cool looking translucent tapes containing 7 of the best episodes of Ranma, including my absolute favorite!
      <br>
      <br>The episodes included are:
      <br>
      <br>Tape 1 (The BEST of (Boy-Type) RANMA):
      <br> - Episode 21, Kissing is Such Sweet Sorrow! The Taking of Akane's Lips
      <br> - Episode 31, Am I... Pretty? Ranma's Declaration of Womanhood (My favorite episode!!!!)
      <br>
      <br>Tape 2 (The BEST of RYOGA):
      <br> - Episode 24, Ryoga & Akane: 2-Gether, 4-Ever
      <br> - Episode 43, Ryoga's Miracle Cure! Hand Over That Soap
      <br>
      <br>Tape 3 (RUMIKO TAKAHASHI “BEST SELECTION”)
      <br> - Episode 48, Ranma Gets Weak!
      <br> - Episode 49, Eureka! The Desperate Move of Desperation
      <br> - Episode 50, Showdown! Can Ranma Make a Comeback?
      <br>
      <br>So yeah! Some really great episodes presented in some of the coolest looking VHS tapes I’ve ever seen (Translucent plastics REALLY need to make a comeback). As far as I know, this is a North American exclusive special edition release put out by Viz Media in 2001. It’s a fairly rare and limited release too! With only 10000 made (I have #3743). As a pretty big fan of Ranma ½, I’m very glad to have gotten my hands on this!! :D 
      <br>
      <br>As the tapes contain special intros, and are also an interesting time capsule of late 90s/early 00s anime releases, I plan on digitizing these tapes and making them available on the Internet Archive. When that happens, the link will be posted here.
